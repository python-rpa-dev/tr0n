# Multi-LLM Collaboration on Public Repositories

## Idea

How can multiple independent LLMs work on the same public repository (e.g., Git) and work on different tasks without getting in each other's way?

## Approaches

### 1. Branch-per-Agent Model (Primary)

Each LLM gets its own feature branch, works independently, and opens a PR when done.

- Git handles the concurrency — merges resolve conflicts
- CI/PR checks catch integration issues before main is affected
- Risk: merge conflicts require human intervention or automated conflict resolution

<!-- TODO: Define conflict resolution priority rules — which side wins when 3+ agents overlap -->

#### Conflict Resolution Priority Rules (3+ Agents)

When 3+ agents' scopes overlap, deterministic priority rules decide:

| Priority | Condition                              | Action                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **1**    | Agent has **earlier confirmed claim**  | Winner — other agents must defer or adjust    |
| **2**    | Same claim time → **shorter scope**    | Winner — less impact, easier to merge         |
| **3**    | Same scope size → **higher task priority** | Winner — business criticality wins       |
| **4**    | Same priority → **first to claim**     | Winner — FIFO, no randomness                  |

**Overlap resolution strategies:**

- **Scope splitting:** earlier claimant keeps the file, later claimant adjusts scope
- **Task deferral:** lower-priority task returns to backlog
- **Task merging:** tightly coupled tasks are assigned to one agent

**Decision flow:**

```
Claim overlap detected?
  │
  ├─→ No overlap → both proceed
  │
  └─→ Overlap → check priority
       │
       ├─→ Clear winner (rule 1-4) → winner proceeds, loser adjusts
       │
       └─→ Tie → user decides
            │
            ├─→ Split scopes → both proceed with adjusted scope
            ├─→ Defer one → one proceeds, other returns to backlog
            └─→ Merge tasks → one agent handles both
```

**Manual operator override:**

When auto-resolution rules are insufficient, a user can manually override:

```bash
# Override: force agent-2 to win, agent-1 defers
tr0n-cli resolve T-042 --winner agent-2 --action defer
```

The override is recorded in the claim file:

```json
{
  "resolution": "manual-override",
  "resolved_by": "user",
  "resolved_at": "2026-05-16T11:00:00Z",
  "override_reason": "Business priority: agent-2's task is more urgent"
}
```

<!-- TODO: Future — manual operator override tool for conflict resolution -->

#### Conflict Resolution

Hybrid approach: auto-merge when files don't overlap, agent-resolve when they do, human only as last resort.

#### Branch Naming Convention

`agent-{id}/{task-id}-{short-desc}`

Examples: `agent-1/T-042-add-auth`, `agent-2/T-043-fix-login-bug`

#### PR Template

Each agent opens a PR with structured body: task ID, agent ID, changed files, test status, and notes.

See [pr-template.md](examples/pr-template.md) for the full template.

#### Stale Base Detection

Before starting: fetch latest `main`, record base commit hash. During CI: check if `main` has moved, auto-rebase if so.

**Rebase vs merge strategy:**

| Strategy | Pros                      | Cons                          | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Rebase   | Linear history, clean     | Rewrites history, risky       | **Default** — when no other agent's work will be lost |
| Merge    | Preserves history         | Merge commits, noisy history  | When other agents' branches are also active |

**Decision logic:**

```
Branch is stale? (main has moved since base commit)
  │
  ├─→ No → proceed normally
  │
  └─→ Yes → check if other agents have active branches
       │
       ├─→ No other active branches → rebase onto latest main
       │
       └─→ Other active branches exist → merge main into branch
            │
            ├─→ No conflicts → auto-merge, continue working
            └─→ Conflicts → agent resolves, pushes, re-runs CI
```

**Stale branch handling commands:**

```bash
# Rebase (when safe)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Merge (when other branches exist)
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main --no-edit

# If merge conflicts
git mergetool  # or manual resolution
git add .
git commit --no-edit
```

#### Round-Call (Pre-Flight Announcement)

Before working, an agent announces its intended scope so others can object.

**Coordination layer:** `tasks/` directory in the repo.

See [task-directory-structure.md](examples/task-directory-structure.md) for the full layout.

**Claim lifecycle:** `pending → confirmed → active → resolved/rejected`

**Claim file format:**

<!-- TODO: Define the full spec for claim file fields and validation rules -->

#### Claim File Field Spec

**Required fields:**

| Field        | Type           | Description                                    |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `task`       | string         | Task ID (e.g., `T-042`)                        |
| `agent`      | string         | Agent ID (e.g., `agent-1`)                     |
| `scope`      | list           | List of file/module paths being modified       |
| `claimed_at` | ISO timestamp  | When the claim was created                     |
| `claim_window` | duration     | How long to wait for objections (e.g., `1h`) |
| `expires_at` | ISO timestamp  | Calculated: `claimed_at + claim_window`        |
| `status`     | enum           | `pending`                                      |

**Optional fields:**

| Field           | Type            | Description                              |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `resolution`    | string          | Resolution result (set when auto-resolved) |
| `adjusted_at`   | ISO timestamp   | When scope was adjusted                  |
| `adjusted_reason`| string         | Why scope was adjusted                   |
| `objections`    | list            | List of objection file paths             |
| `notes`         | string          | Any additional context                   |

**Validation rules:**

1. `expires_at` must be in the future
2. `scope` must not be empty
3. `scope` paths must use forward slashes
4. `claim_window` must be a valid duration (parsable)
5. `status` must be a valid enum value
6. `claimed_at` must be before `expires_at`

**Computed fields (auto-generated):**

| Field        | Source                    |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| `expires_at` | `claimed_at + claim_window` |
| `status`     | Automatically updated by system |

See [task-claim.md](examples/task-claim.md) for a complete example.

**Flexible claim window:**
- Default: configurable at system level (e.g., 1 hour)
- User can override: `"work on T-042, claim window 30min"`
- Auto-promotes to `confirmed` after window expires with no objections
- Expired claims can be reclaimed, reassigned, or discarded

**Conflict resolution:** when two claims overlap, coordinator decides — merge scopes, defer the later claim, or split the work.

<!-- TODO: Define objection format and resolution protocol -->

#### Objection Format and Resolution Protocol

An objection is a file under `tasks/objections/<task-id>/<agent>.md`:

```
tasks/active/
└── T-042-agent-1.md
tasks/objections/
└── T-042-agent-1/
    └── T-043-agent-2.md
```

**Objection file:**

```markdown
## Objecting to
T-042 (agent-1) — claim for T-042

## My overlapping task
T-043 (agent-2) — claim for T-043

## Overlap
- src/auth/session.py  ← both tasks modify this file

## Proposed resolution
- Split: agent-1 keeps src/auth/login.py, agent-2 gets src/auth/session.py
- Defer: T-043 returns to backlog until T-042 is merged
```

**Resolution protocol:**

1. When overlap is detected, both claims marked `pending-resolution`
2. Priority rules decide a winner automatically (if clear)
3. If tie → user must decide (manual intervention)
4. Loser's claim is adjusted or returned to backlog
5. Both claims updated with resolution, move back to `pending` or `confirmed`

**Auto-resolution (priority rules decide):**

```
Tie-breaker applied:
- T-042 claimed at 10:00 (earlier) → WINNER
- T-043 claimed at 10:05 → LOSER

Resolution: T-043 scope adjusted to exclude src/auth/
```

**User resolution (tie):**

```markdown
## Resolution
User decided: split scopes
- agent-1 keeps src/auth/
- agent-2 gets src/sessions/ (adjusted)

## Resolved at
2026-05-16T10:30:00Z
## Resolved by
user
```

### 5. Manual CI with Non-Blocking Tasks

CI is **manual** — user or another agent runs it after an agent opens a PR.

**PR statuses:**

| Status       | Meaning                        | Can agent work on something else? |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `awaiting-ci`| PR open, CI not yet run        | Yes — non-blocking tasks          |
| `ci-passed`  | CI passed, ready to merge      | Yes                               |
| `ci-failed`  | CI failed, needs fix           | No — agent must fix               |
| `ready-to-merge` | Approved, waiting for human merge | Yes                       |

**Agent workflow on task completion:**

1. Agent opens PR → marks as `awaiting-ci`
2. Agent checks PR status → if `awaiting-ci`, looks for non-blocking tasks
3. Agent picks up another task from backlog (no dependency on pending PR)
4. When CI passes → PR marked `ready-to-merge`
5. When CI fails → agent gets failures, fixes, re-opens `awaiting-ci`

**Non-blocking task detection:**

Tasks declare dependencies:

```markdown
## Task
T-045: Add logging module

## Depends-on
- T-042 (auth)  ← blocker

## Scope
- src/logging/
```

Agent checks backlog for tasks with **no dependency** on the pending PR.

**Agent decision logic:**

```
PR #42 status: awaiting-ci
  │
  └─→ Check backlog for non-blocking tasks
       │
       ├─→ Found T-045 (no deps) → pick it up
       └─→ No non-blocking tasks → idle / wait
```

### 2. Feature Flag / Modular Architecture

Design the codebase so agents work in isolated modules with stable interfaces.

- Agents modify different files/modules with minimal overlap
- Interface contracts (types, APIs) are the boundary — as long as those don't change, modules can evolve independently
- Requires intentional architecture from the start

### 3. Future Extensions

Task queue with file-level or module-level locking. A central orchestrator assigns discrete tasks to agents with locks to prevent simultaneous edits on the same file. More sophisticated but avoids blocking.

### 4. Future: Docker Containerization

Pin agent environments in Docker containers for deterministic, reproducible builds. Currently deferred — agents run on native shell environments (Windows/Linux/macOS).

## Agent Lifecycle

### Stages

| Stage        | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **idle**     | Agent exists but has no active task                 |
| **claiming** | Agent initiated a round-call, waiting for claim window |
| **working**  | Claim confirmed, agent is on its branch making changes |
| **reviewing**| PR opened, waiting for CI/review results               |
| **merged**   | PR merged into `main`                                  |
| **terminated**| Agent shut down, no longer active                     |

<!-- TODO: Define transition rules — what triggers each state change, who can initiate it -->

#### Agent State Transition Rules

| Transition               | Trigger                                           | Who initiates     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `idle → claiming`        | User assigns task to agent                        | User/coordinator  |
| `claiming → working`     | Claim window expires with no objections           | Auto (system)     |
| `claiming → idle`        | Objection received + resolution deferred          | Auto (system)     |
| `claiming → claiming`    | Objection received + auto-resolved (loser adjusts)| Auto (system)     |
| `working → reviewing`    | Agent pushes branch and opens PR                  | Agent             |
| `working → claiming`     | Claim expires before PR opened                    | Auto (system)     |
| `reviewing → merged`     | CI passes + review approved + user merges         | User (manual)     |
| `reviewing → working`    | CI fails or review rejects → agent fixes          | Auto (system)     |
| `reviewing → reviewing`  | CI fails → agent pushes fix, CI re-runs          | Agent             |
| `merged → terminated`    | All tasks complete or user terminates             | User              |
| `terminated → idle`      | Agent reactivated with new task                   | User/coordinator  |

**Agent state update mechanism:**

When a transition happens, the agent updates its identity file:

```json
{
  "id": "agent-1",
  "status": "reviewing",
  "current_task": "T-042",
  "current_branch": "agent-1/T-042-add-auth",
  "last_transition": "2026-05-16T10:30:00Z",
  "transition_trigger": "pr_opened"
}
```

#### Claim State Transitions

| Transition               | Trigger                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `pending → confirmed`    | Claim window expires with no objections              |
| `pending → pending-resolution` | Objection received                            |
| `pending → rejected`     | Priority rules decide loser                          |
| `confirmed → active`     | Agent starts working                                 |
| `active → resolved`      | PR merged                                            |
| `active → rejected`      | User forces cancellation                             |
| `pending-resolution → confirmed` | Auto-resolved (winner)                        |
| `pending-resolution → active`    | Winner starts working                         |
| `pending-resolution → rejected`  | Loser's claim rejected                          |

**Edge cases:**

- **Claim expires while pending:** claim → `expired`, agent → `idle`
- **Agent terminates while working:** PR stays open, task → `incomplete`, agent → `terminated`
- **Agent terminates while reviewing:** PR stays open, task → `awaiting-ci`, agent → `terminated`

### Lifecycle Flow

```
idle
  │
  ├──→ claiming ──(window expires, no objections)──→ working
  │        │
  │        └──(objection received)──→ idle (re-claim with adjusted scope)
  │
  ├──→ working ──(PR opened)──→ reviewing
  │        │
  │        └──(claim expired)──→ idle (re-claim)

  │        └──(CI fails / review rejects)──→ working (fix and push)
  │
  ├──→ merged ──→ terminated
  │
  └──→ terminated
```

### Agent Registration

Each agent has a persistent identity stored in **two locations**:

| Location | Purpose | Tracked? |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `config/local/agent.json` (local) | Agent's own identity and config — private | ❌ No (gitignored) |
| `agents/agent-{uuid}.json` (repo) | Agent state (status, task, branch) — shared | ✅ Yes |

**Agent identity resolution:**

1. Agent reads its own ID from `config/local/agent.json` (local, private)
2. Agent reads other agents' states from `agents/` (repo, shared)
3. Agent reads its own state from `agents/agent-{id}.json` (repo, shared)

**How the agent knows it's itself:**

Compares its local config ID against files in `agents/`. If the ID matches its own config → it's itself. If different → it's another agent.

**First run flow:**

```
Agent starts
  │
  ├─→ config/local/agent.json exists?
  │     ├─→ Yes → read ID from config
  │     └─→ No → generate UUID
  │
  └─→ Write ID to config/local/agent.json
```

#### Agent ID Naming Convention

**Format:** `agent-{base62-encoded-uuid}`

Examples: `agent-7xK9mPqR2vN4wY8jL1bZ`, `agent-m3pL9vN2xR5wY8jK1bZ`

**How uniqueness is guaranteed:**

1. On first run, agent generates a UUID v4 (122 random bits)
2. Encodes the UUID in base62 (22 characters)
3. Creates file `agents/agent-{id}.json`
4. Collision probability: negligible (same as raw UUID v4)

**Why base62:**

| Format                | Length    | Safe?                    |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Full UUID (hyphenated) | 36 chars  | Yes, but long filenames  |
| Full UUID (hex)        | 32 chars  | Yes, still long          |
| Truncated hex (8 chars)| 8 chars   | No — birthday paradox    |
| Base62-encoded UUID    | 22 chars  | Yes — best balance       |

**Agent ID file in repo:**

```
agents/
├── agent-7xK9mPqR2vN4wY8j.json    # Active agent
├── agent-m3pL9vN2xR5wY8jK1bZ.json # Active agent
└── archived/
    └── agent-a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j.json  # Terminated agent
```

**Renaming:** If an agent wants to change its ID:

1. Moves its own file to `archived/`
2. Creates a new file with the new ID
3. Updates all references in `tasks/`

#### Agent Identity File Format

The agent identity file at `agents/agent-{id}.json` contains:

```json
{
  "id": "agent-7xK9mPqR2vN4wY8jL1bZ",
  "environment": {
    "os": "windows",
    "os_version": "11",
    "shell": "powershell",
    "shell_version": "7.4",
    "tools": {
      "python": "3.11.9",
      "node": "20.11.0",
      "git": "2.43.0",
      "docker": null,
      "gh": "2.43.0"
    },
    "installed": ["python", "node", "git", "gh"],
    "missing": ["docker"]
  },
  "status": "idle",
  "current_task": null,
  "current_branch": null,
  "last_transition": "2026-05-16T10:30:00Z",
  "transition_trigger": "first_run",
  "created": "2026-05-16T09:00:00Z",
  "total_tasks_completed": 0,
  "expertise": []
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Agent ID (base62 UUID) |
| `environment` | object | Detected platform and tools |
| `environment.os` | string | OS name (windows, linux, macos) |
| `environment.os_version` | string | OS version |
| `environment.shell` | string | Shell name (powershell, bash, zsh) |
| `environment.shell_version` | string | Shell version |
| `environment.tools` | object | Detected tool versions (null = not found) |
| `environment.installed` | string[] | Tool names that were found |
| `environment.missing` | string[] | Tool names that were not found |
| `status` | enum | Agent lifecycle state |
| `current_task` | string\|null | Current task ID (e.g., `T-042`) |
| `current_branch` | string\|null | Current branch name |
| `last_transition` | ISO timestamp | When the last state change occurred |
| `transition_trigger` | string | What caused the last transition |
| `created` | ISO timestamp | When the agent was first created |
| `total_tasks_completed` | int | Lifetime task count |
| `expertise` | string[] | Agent's specialization areas |

**Agent state values:**

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `idle` | No active task |
| `claiming` | Initiated round-call, waiting for claim window |
| `working` | Claim confirmed, on branch making changes |
| `reviewing` | PR opened, waiting for CI/review |
| `merged` | PR merged into main |
| `terminated` | No longer active |

**Local config file** (`config/local/agent.json`) contains the same fields plus:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Human-readable agent name |
| `platform` | string | Target platform |
| `missing_tools` | string[] | Tools not installed (duplicate of env.missing) |

See [agent-identity.json](examples/agent-identity.json) for a complete example.

### Task Assignment

A coordinator (or user) assigns tasks to agents:

1. Task is created in a `tasks/` directory (separate from active claims)
2. Coordinator matches task to agent by **expertise** or **availability**
3. Agent receives the task and enters the **claiming** stage

#### Task ID Naming Convention

**Format:** `T-NNN` (sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits)

Examples: `T-001`, `T-042`, `T-100`

**How uniqueness is guaranteed:**

1. Coordinator (user or system) maintains a counter in `config/local/coordinator.json`
2. Each new task increments the counter by 1
3. Counter is never reused — even completed/terminated tasks keep their ID
4. Counter persists across agent sessions and restarts

**Why sequential:**

| Format          | Example      | Pros                      | Cons                        |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Sequential      | `T-042`     | Ordering, simplicity      | Requires counter management |
| Hash-based      | `T-a3f8b2`  | No coordination needed    | No ordering, hard to read   |
| Timestamp-based | `T-20260516`| Self-describing           | Collisions, no ordering     |

#### Task Definition File

Each task gets a file in `tasks/backlog/T-NNN-<desc>.md`:

```markdown
## Task
T-042: Add user authentication module

## Assigned to
agent-7xK9mPqR2vN4wY8jL1bZ

## Priority
high

## Scope
- src/auth/
- tests/test_auth/

## Depends-on
- T-040 (database setup)

## Requirements
- platform: any
- python >= 3.11
- tool: git

## Test coverage
- Unit tests: 80% minimum
- Integration tests: auth flow

## Documentation
- Update README.md
- Update API docs
```

See [task-definition.md](examples/task-definition.md) for a complete example.

See [task-directory-structure.md](examples/task-directory-structure.md) for the full layout.

### Shutdown / Termination

- **Graceful:** agent finishes current task → terminates
- **Forced:** coordinator/user forces shutdown
  - If agent is **idle/claiming** → safe to terminate
  - If agent is **working** → PR stays open, task marked as incomplete, another agent can pick it up
  - Branch is preserved (not deleted) for inspection

### Resource Management

- Agents are **ephemeral** — each time an agent "wakes up", it reads its state from the repo
- No long-lived connections or persistent sessions needed
- State is **declarative** (JSON files + Git) — the repo is the source of truth

## Multi-Platform Agent Design

### Task Compatibility Check

Before assigning a task, check requirements against agent capabilities:

| Task requirement      | Agent capability | Result                        |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `platform: linux`     | `windows`        | ❌ Incompatible — warn user   |
| `tool: docker`        | no docker        | ❌ Warn — suggest installing  |
| `python >= 3.11`      | `3.12`           | ✅ Compatible                 |
| `platform: any`       | any              | ✅ Compatible                 |

Tasks declare requirements:

See [task-definition.md](examples/task-definition.md) for a complete example.

### Cross-Platform Handling

**Git is the universal layer** — all coordination happens through Git, which works identically on all platforms.

**File paths in task scope:** use forward slashes (POSIX-style), Git normalizes them:
- `src/auth/` works on both Windows and Linux
- Never use `src\auth\` in task declarations

**Shell-agnostic coordination:** the coordinator only uses Git commands (not shell-specific ones):
- ✅ `git fetch`, `git checkout`, `git push`
- ❌ `ls`, `rm`, `mkdir` (use Git-aware alternatives)

Agents run their own local commands (tests, lint, builds) in their native shell — that's fine. Coordination stays Git-only.

### Local Tool Detection

When an agent wakes up, it detects its environment and updates its identity file:

```bash
# Detection script: agent/detect-env.sh (cross-platform)
# Output format (machine-readable):
os=windows version=11 shell=powershell version=7.4
python=3.11.9 node=20.11.0 git=2.43.0 docker=not-found
```

**Detection commands (cross-platform):**

| Tool    | Windows (PowerShell)                          | Linux/macOS (bash)           |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| OS      | `$env:OS` / `systeminfo`                      | `uname -s` / `sw_vers`       |
| Shell   | `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`                   | `$SHELL` / `bash --version`  |
| Python  | `python --version`                            | `python3 --version`           |
| Node    | `node --version`                              | `node --version`               |
| Git     | `git --version`                               | `git --version`                |
| Docker  | `docker --version`                            | `docker --version`             |

**Identity file update:**

```json
{
  "id": "agent-7xK9mPqR2vN4wY8jL1bZ",
  "environment": {
    "os": "windows",
    "os_version": "11",
    "shell": "powershell",
    "shell_version": "7.4",
    "tools": {
      "python": "3.11.9",
      "node": "20.11.0",
      "git": "2.43.0",
      "docker": null
    }
  },
  "status": "idle",
  "last_sync": "2026-05-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Compatibility check:** before task assignment, the coordinator compares task requirements against `environment.tools`:

```
Task T-044 requires: docker
Agent environment: docker = null
Result: ❌ Incompatible — defer task
```

### Fallback Strategy

When a task requires something an agent doesn't have:
1. **Warn the user** — "Task T-044 requires aws-cli, not found on this machine"
2. **Suggest alternatives** — installation instructions for the platform
3. **Defer** — task stays in backlog until a compatible agent picks it up

## Config File Convention

To prevent personal config files from being overwritten by future updates, the repo uses a **template + local** pattern.

```
config/
├── templates/
│   ├── agent.json.example    # Template — tracked in git
│   └── settings.json.example # Template — tracked in git
└── local/                    # User-specific — gitignored
    ├── agent.json            # Copy from agent.json.example
    └── settings.json         # Copy from settings.json.example
```

Users copy `.example` files to their local versions. Local versions are gitignored, so:
- `git pull` never overwrites user configs
- Templates can be updated without affecting local files
- Diff shows only template changes, not user noise

**Agent state files** (`agents/`, `tasks/`) are repo-state and remain tracked.

## Agent Design

### Launch Command

```
tr0n-agent --task T-042
```

Or with claim window override:

```
tr0n-agent --task T-042 --claim-window 30min
```

### Agent Lifecycle on Launch

1. Reads its identity from `config/local/agent.json` (or `config/templates/agent.json.example` if no local copy)
2. Fetches latest `main` from remote
3. Reads the task from `tasks/assigned/T-042-<agent-id>.md`
4. Initiates round-call — creates claim in `tasks/active/`
5. Waits for claim window (polling, not blocking — picks up other tasks if claimed)
6. Creates branch `agent-{id}/T-042-<desc>` from latest `main`
7. Works on the task
8. Opens PR when done
9. Exits — agent is ephemeral, no persistent process needed

### Alternative: No-args Mode

```
tr0n-agent
```

Agent looks for an available task in `tasks/assigned/` (matched to its expertise), then follows the same flow.

### Configurable via env vars:

```bash
TR0N_AGENT_ID=agent-1 tr0n-agent
TR0N_CLAIM_WINDOW=2h tr0n-agent --task T-042
```

### Two Modes of Operation

#### 1. Standalone Agent (default)

A CLI tool that handles the full workflow: claim, branch, work, PR.

```
tr0n-agent --task T-042
```

#### 2. Protocol over stdin/stdout (for existing LLM clients)

The agent exposes a **protocol** that any LLM client can speak:

```
tr0n-agent --protocol
```

The client sends commands via stdin and reads responses via stdout:

```
> claim task T-042 scope "src/auth/"
< {"status": "pending", "expires": "2026-05-16T11:30:00Z"}

> check conflicts
< {"conflicts": []}

> create branch agent-1/T-042
< {"branch": "agent-1/T-042", "base": "abc123"}

> push branch
< {"status": "ok", "pr_url": "https://..."}
```

This way **opencode**, **aichat**, or any other LLM client can drive the agent as a sub-tool. The LLM client handles the reasoning; the agent handles the Git operations and coordination.

### Minimal JS Implementation

**Runtime:** Node.js (already installed on most dev machines)

**Dependencies:** zero npm packages. Uses only Node built-in modules:

| Need             | Built-in module      |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Git commands     | `child_process.exec` |
| JSON             | `fs.readFileSync`    |
| File I/O         | `fs`                 |
| Path handling    | `path`               |
| Argument parsing | `process.argv`       |

**Operations via:**

| Operation                    | Tool              |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Git operations (fetch, checkout, push) | `git` CLI |
| PR creation/management       | `gh` CLI          |
| File updates (config, claims)| `git` (commit + push) |

No HTTP library needed — `gh` handles everything. If `gh` is not available, the agent can use `git` to push and the user manually creates the PR.

**Structure:**

```
agent/
├── agent.js          # Main entry point
├── claim.js          # Round-call logic
├── git.js            # Git operations
├── conflict.js       # Conflict detection/resolution
└── protocol.js       # stdin/stdout protocol
```

Single-file version is also possible — `agent.js` with everything inline.

### Language for Agent Implementation

**Decision: JavaScript (Node.js)**

| Criterion              | JavaScript | Python   | Shell    | Rust     |
|------------------------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Zero dependencies      | ✅ (built-in modules) | ❌ (needs packages) | ✅ | ❌ (compiler) |
| JSON handling          | ✅ (built-in) | ✅ (built-in) | ❌ | ✅ (serde) |
| Git CLI integration    | ✅ (`child_process`) | ✅ (`subprocess`) | ✅ | ✅ (std::process) |
| `gh` CLI integration   | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross-platform         | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (shell differences) | ✅ |
| Community examples     | ✅✅✅ | ✅✅✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Install size           | ✅ (~20MB) | ✅ (~50MB) | ✅ | ⚠️ (compiler toolchain) |

**Chosen approach:**

- Runtime: Node.js (built-in modules only, zero npm dependencies)
- Git operations: `git` CLI via `child_process.exec`
- PR operations: `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI)
- Config/claims: JSON file I/O via `fs` module
- Structure: modular files (`agent.js`, `claim.js`, `git.js`, `conflict.js`, `protocol.js`)
- Fallback: if `gh` is unavailable, agent pushes branch and user manually creates PR

**Why not Python:**
- Python requires virtualenv/dependencies for most useful operations
- Node.js is already installed on most dev machines
- Zero-dependency requirement favors Node built-ins over Python packages

**Why not shell:**
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows PowerShell vs bash)
- JSON parsing is fragile in shell
- Less maintainable for complex logic

<!-- TODO: Add principle about documentation updates required alongside code changes -->

| Principle              | Why it matters                                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Small, atomic tasks    | Less overlap = fewer conflicts                           |
| Stable interfaces      | Agents can change internals without breaking others      |
| Frequent integration   | Catch conflicts early, not at the end                    |
| Deterministic outputs  | Reduces "two agents do different things to the same code"|
| Clear ownership        | Assign files/modules to specific agents when possible    |
| Test coverage required | Every agent must update tests for its changes            |
| Docs update required   | Every agent must update docs alongside code changes      |

#### Test Coverage Requirements Per Agent

Every agent working on a task must:

1. **Write tests** for any new functionality or modified behavior
2. **Maintain minimum coverage** as declared in the task definition (e.g., 80%)
3. **Run existing test suite** — no regressions allowed
4. **Add integration tests** for cross-module changes

**Test requirements by task type:**

| Task type         | Unit tests | Integration tests | E2E tests |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| New feature       | Required   | Required          | If applicable |
| Bug fix           | Required (regression test) | If applicable | If applicable |
| Refactor          | Required   | Required          | If applicable |
| Docs only         | Not required | Not required    | Not required |
| Config only       | Not required | Not required    | If applicable |

**CI validation:**

- PR must pass all existing tests
- New tests must be included in the PR
- Coverage report attached to PR comment
- Below minimum coverage → PR blocked until fixed
